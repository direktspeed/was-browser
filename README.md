# Project WAS? was was-b wasb wasm-browser
Its a Web Browser Like Technology that does not work with HTML or a Markup Language it exposes a window api that you can use via WASM.
it is the reference implementation of the https://github.com/was-protocol which is based on WASI and diffrent Transport layer Protocols.

Was is the german word for what and also is the used Acronym for Web Assembly so we decided to Call our App The WAS Browser.

as that term is a word that comes often in search engines its always clever to rever to this project as direktspeed-was or direkt-was dspeed-was was-browser so you find the right resources. 


## Project state
We are Working on this while we are working on our other Projects Like https://github.com/open-pwa/open-pwa because of shared code and functionality we are currntly building up roadmaps and start to tackle the issues. We have not Affilates that help us and we Plan to do it all Open Source and for Free. As we think that is clear the future.

## Why?
It solves a lot of problems that exist in the current Internet(HTML+JS+CSS) World. HTML and all what followed got build as there was no alternativ with the WASM Spec we finally can Create a New kind of Platform and Internet at a Whole. Where All this listed Problems are addressed.

- Use your Existing Coding language (C, GO, RUST, C++, C#, JAVA)
- Use even more languages and code like https://github.com/lumen/lumen allows usage of Erlang C inside Wasm
- Content Stealing
- A Lot of Security issues on the Provider and Client side
- Less Compatibility Problems.
- Reduce Amount of Code layers
- No Other Browser Needed as You can Even run a HTML Render engine as WASM.
- Reduces overall App Development Efforts and Complexity
- Higher Code Reuse then ever before


## How?

https://github.com/was-protocol/was-protocol


## Offering diffrent Interfaces
- [ ] SDL 2+ mixer ttf
- [ ] x11 Pulse Audio

## Define a Uniq API that Abstracts our Underlaying Graphics, Sound, ...Device Capabilitys.


## Problems
We want to design a secure Platform as new way to consume Applications and Content so we need to define Something similar to a browser but more Secure.

- [ ] TaskManager
- [ ] WindowManager
- [ ] Firewall
- [ ] Most Best Unikernels some how

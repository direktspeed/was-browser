# Project WAS? was was-b wasb
Its a Web Browser Like Technology that does not work with HTML or a Markup Language it exposes a window api that you can use via WASM.

Was is the german word for what and also is the used Acronym for Web Assembly so we decided to Call our App The WAS Browser.

as that term is a word that comes often in search engines its always clever to rever to this project as direktspeed-was or direkt-was dspeed-was was-browser so you find the right resources. 


## Project state
We are Working on this while we are working on our other Projects Like open-pwa because of shared code and functionality we are currntly building up roadmaps and start to tackle the issues. We have not Affilates that help us and we Plan to do it all Open Source and for Free. As we think that is clear the future.
